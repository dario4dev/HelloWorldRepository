Dear Riebeling/Simple Net GmbH,

we are writing this post as a group of people that are living in Studio B that have a serious, unresolved problem: internet connection is not stable, and the service that is provided is unacceptable.
We reported many times to Simple Net GmbH, they told that they would fix it, but we are in these situation since months.

Please, don't ingore us thi time, or we would find another way to have a decent service.

Kindly Regards,
